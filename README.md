# personal portfolio challenge with advanced CSS style techniques learned in week 2 of bootcamp. Particularly flexbox, variable, and button:hover/::after functions

# https://ceresmarkley.github.io/markley-portfolio/ - link to live deployed URL

# site has function nav bar to webpage content as well as link to resume. "my work" article section has image button of previous websites with attached links that will bring you to those webpages.

# hovering over buttons will change cursor to 'pointer' and makes button 'pulse' a variable background color

# css uses :root element settings that are then called throughout css page
